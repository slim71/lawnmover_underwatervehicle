# Part of the design of a lawn-mover underwater project

This file have been used and implemented for the project of the course 
*Underwater vehicles*, part of the Master Degree in 
[Robotics and Automation Engineering](http://www.aut.ing.unipi.it/), attended 
at the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/).

Our team was tasked with the design of a Supervisor module. The main goals were:
- provide reference points to the subsequent module
- check the vehicle kinematics variable and their evolution
- decide the course of action in different situations (e.g. when encountering an obstacle)

The other modules were designed by other teams, for an amount of about 20 people
in total.

The simulated environment was a portion of the seabed near the Isola del Giglio
(Italy), which the robot would have to scan following a lawn-mover exploration.
